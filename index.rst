Welcome to Exrin!
===========================================

.. image:: exrin_128.png

A Xamarin Forms Application Framework designed to enable teams to develop consistent, reliable and highly performant mobile apps. Exrin lets you put more focus on how the app will look and functionality, while it takes care of handling many common tasks.

An extended MVVM framework is the best way to think of Exrin, with additional features including:

- Stack based Navigation Service
- ViewModel ICommand Operations
- Insights Wrapper
- Thread Helpers

There are no dependencies on Xamarin Forms, hence this will work with any version.
